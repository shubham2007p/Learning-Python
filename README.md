📚 Python Learning Journey – From Basics to Projects
Welcome to my Python Learning Journey repository!
This repo documents my step-by-step progress as I learn Python — starting from the fundamentals and steadily moving toward advanced concepts, data handling, and real-world projects. Whether you’re also learning Python or simply curious about my approach, you’ll find organized code, examples, and notes here.

🎯 Purpose of This Repository
I created this space to:

Keep track of my learning path and practice exercises.

Build a personal code library I can revisit and improve.

Share clear, well-commented examples that can help other learners.

Transition from theory into problem-solving and project building.

📂 Structure
The repository is organized into learning modules:

Basics – Variables, data types, operators, input/output, control flow.

Functions – Parameters, return values, scope, recursion.

Data Structures – Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and their operations.

File Handling – Reading/writing files, CSV handling, JSON parsing.

Modules & Libraries – Using Python’s standard library and third-party packages.

NumPy & Pandas – Data analysis essentials.

Mini Projects – Applying concepts to real tasks.

🛠 Tools & Practices
Python Version: 3.x

Coding Style: PEP 8 compliant with meaningful variable names and comments.

Version Control: Regular commits documenting progress.

Learning Resources: Online courses, documentation, and personal experiments.

🚀 Progress & Goals
This is not just a static code dump — it’s a living record. Over time, I’ll add:

More advanced Python concepts (OOP, decorators, generators).

Data science and machine learning implementations.

Larger projects integrating multiple skills.

💡 Contribution
This is mainly a personal learning repo, but suggestions and feedback are welcome! If you notice an error or have an idea for improvement, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

“Code, Learn, Improve — Repeat.”
