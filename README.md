## **📚 Python Learning Journey – From Basics to Projects**

Welcome to my **Python Learning Journey** repository!
This repo documents my step-by-step progress as I learn Python — starting from the fundamentals and steadily moving toward advanced concepts, data handling, and real-world projects. Whether you’re also learning Python or simply curious about my approach, you’ll find organized code, examples, and notes here.

### **🎯 Purpose of This Repository**

I created this space to:

* Keep track of my learning path and practice exercises.
* Build a personal code library I can revisit and improve.
* Share clear, well-commented examples that can help other learners.
* Transition from theory into problem-solving and project building.

### **📂 Structure**

The repository is organized into learning modules:

1. **Basics** – Variables, data types, operators, input/output, control flow.
2. **Functions** – Parameters, return values, scope, recursion.
3. **Data Structures** – Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and their operations.
4. **File Handling** – Reading/writing files, CSV handling, JSON parsing.
5. **Modules & Libraries** – Using Python’s standard library and third-party packages.
6. **NumPy & Pandas** – Data analysis essentials.
7. **Mini Projects** – Applying concepts to real tasks.

### **🛠 Tools & Practices**

* **Python Version:** 3.x
* **Coding Style:** PEP 8 compliant with meaningful variable names and comments.
* **Version Control:** Regular commits documenting progress.
* **Learning Resources:** Online courses, documentation, and personal experiments.

### **🚀 Progress & Goals**

This is not just a static code dump — it’s a living record. Over time, I’ll add:

* More advanced Python concepts (OOP, decorators, generators).
* Data science and machine learning implementations.
* Larger projects integrating multiple skills.

### **💡 Contribution**

This is mainly a personal learning repo, but suggestions and feedback are welcome! If you notice an error or have an idea for improvement, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
